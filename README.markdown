ethos Toolkit for Google App Engine
===================================

I love me some Google App Engine. And while I do love me some Django, too, sometimes
the full Django stack is just too much. Anymore, I prefer writing small, ReSTful
applications using just `webapp` and `webapp2`, `Mako+HAML` templates, and `WTForms`.
This little toolkit describes that stack nicely and provides some nice integrations
for them as well as some decent unit testing tools for `RequestHandler` classes.
